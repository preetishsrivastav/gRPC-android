To fetch data from an API using gRPC, you'll need to follow these steps:

Define the gRPC service in a .proto file: Create a .proto file where you define the API service and message types. Specify the method(s) you want to use to fetch data from the API. For example:

Generate code from the .proto file: Use the Protocol Buffers Compiler (protoc) to generate the necessary code in your desired language (e.g., Java, Kotlin), I have used Kotlin. Run the following command in the terminal at the root of your project:

Implement the gRPC client: Create a gRPC client class that handles communication with the API. The client class should utilize the generated code from the .proto file

Use the gRPC client to fetch data: In your Android activity or fragment, create an instance of the APIServiceClient and use it to fetch data from the API

the FetchDataTask asynchronously fetches data from the API using the apiServiceClient.fetchData() method. The fetched data is passed to the onPostExecute() method, where you can handle it as needed (e.g., update UI, perform additional operations).

These steps provide a basic structure for fetching data from an API using gRPC in android framework
